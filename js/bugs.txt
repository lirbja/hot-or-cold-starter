* User is allowed to keep guessing even if they won

* Clicking "New Game" doesn't start a new game

* User's input field is not cleared after user clicks Submit

* Hotter vs Colder:
	- if diff between last guess and sysNumber is smaller than diff between second-to-last guess and sysNumber, then hotter
	- if diff between last guess and sysNumber is greater than diff between second-to-last guess and sysNumber, then colder
