//BUGS////////////



1) newGame() is starting on click of a button, rather than page load
	(newGame should start on document.ready)
		(generating sysNumber should start on document.ready and not repeat itself)
	(storing user guess should happen on button click)
		(providing feedback should happen on button click)
		(storing guess should happen on button click)
		(error handling should happen on button click)
		(counting # of user guesses should happen on button click)

2) user is being allowed to guess the same guess more than once

3) clicking New Game is not triggering the newGame function that starts the game

4) hotter and colder functionality is not there
	(if the difference between their last guess and the sysNumber is less than the difference between their second-to-last guess and the sysNumber, then say 'hotter')
	(if the difference between their last guess and the sysNumber is less than the difference between their second-to-last guess and the sysNumber, then say 'colder')
